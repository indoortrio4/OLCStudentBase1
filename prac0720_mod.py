Algorithm Question:
Given a list of random numbers, Write a program to determine which 
numbers in the list are even or odd.

# # Exercise 1: Points Game
# """
# In this game, players collect points that are added to their total score. 
# The player can only see the last digit of their score on a display. 
# Your task is to write a Python program that takes the playerâ€™s total score 
# as input and returns the last digit of the score.

# Example input: 12345
# Expected output: 5

# HINT: Use the modulus operator (%) to find the last digit of the score.

# score = 12345
x = int(input("enter your score: "))
print(f"The last digit of {x} is {x%1000}")
